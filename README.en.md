# Safe Clone - Isolated Repo Security Scanner

> [繁體中文版](README.md)

Scan untrusted repos inside a Docker sandbox before cloning to your host.

## Architecture

Two-layer design: the host orchestrates, the container does all the dirty work.

```
  Your Mac (Host)                          Docker Container (Isolated)
  +---------------------------+            +--------------------------------+
  |  safe-clone.sh            |--docker--->|  repo_security_scan.sh         |
  |  (Orchestrator)           |    run     |  (Scanner)                     |
  |                           |            |                                |
  |  1. GitHub API preflight  |            |  1. git clone (hooks disabled) |
  |  2. Launch Docker         |            |  2. Gitleaks -- secrets        |
  |  3. Collect reports       |<--volume---|  3. Trivy -- CVE & misconfig   |
  |  4. Destroy container     |   mount    |  4. Bandit -- Python           |
  +---------------------------+            |  5. npm audit -- Node.js       |
                                           |  6. pip-audit -- Python deps   |
                                           |  7. Custom rules -- behaviors  |
                                           |  8. Generate report -> /output |
                                           +--------------------------------+
```

## Why?

You find an interesting repo on GitHub and want to clone it. But:

- Git hooks can execute arbitrary code during clone
- Malicious scripts may hide in `package.json` `postinstall`
- Secrets may have leaked in commit history
- Dependencies may have known vulnerabilities

**Safe Clone** runs all checks in a Docker isolated environment. Your host is never touched.

## Features

| Scan | Tool | Detects |
|------|------|---------|
| Secrets | [Gitleaks](https://github.com/gitleaks/gitleaks) | API keys, passwords, tokens, private keys |
| Vulnerabilities | [Trivy](https://github.com/aquasecurity/trivy) | CVEs, license issues, misconfigurations |
| Python static analysis | [Bandit](https://github.com/PyCQA/bandit) | Python security issues |
| Node.js deps | npm audit | Known npm package vulnerabilities |
| Python deps | [pip-audit](https://github.com/pypa/pip-audit) | Known Python package vulnerabilities |
| Behavior analysis | Custom rules | Reverse shells, crypto mining, obfuscation, typosquatting |

### Security Measures

- **GitHub API preflight** — Risk assessment before clone (stars, age, owner)
- **Docker sandbox** — `--cap-drop=ALL`, `--security-opt=no-new-privileges`, resource limits
- **Git hooks disabled** — `core.hooksPath=/dev/null` during clone
- **Trivy DB cache** — Named volume, no re-download every scan

## Prerequisites

- Docker

That's it. All scanning tools are bundled in the Docker image.

## Install

```bash
git clone https://github.com/aiondaily/safe-clone.git
cd safe-clone
chmod +x safe-clone.sh
```

## Usage

```bash
# Scan a GitHub repo
./safe-clone.sh https://github.com/someone/cool-project

# Skip GitHub API preflight
./safe-clone.sh --no-preflight https://github.com/someone/cool-project

# Force scan high-risk repo
./safe-clone.sh --force https://github.com/someone/sketchy-repo

# Build/update Docker image only
./safe-clone.sh --build

# Keep container after scan (debug)
./safe-clone.sh --keep https://github.com/someone/cool-project
```

### Run scanner directly (without Docker)

If you already have gitleaks, trivy, etc. installed locally:

```bash
# Scan remote repo
./repo_security_scan.sh https://github.com/someone/cool-project

# Scan local directory
./repo_security_scan.sh ./my-local-repo
```

## Report Output

Reports are saved to `scan_reports/<repo_name>_<timestamp>/`:

```
scan_reports/cool-project_20260328_143000/

## Exit Codes

| Code | Meaning |
|------|---------|
| 0 | Pass — no issues found |
| 1 | Security risks detected |
| 2 | Tool execution error |

## GitHub Token (Optional)

Set `GITHUB_TOKEN` to avoid API rate limits:

```bash
export GITHUB_TOKEN=ghp_your_token_here
./safe-clone.sh https://github.com/someone/cool-project
```
